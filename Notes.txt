    Binary classification 
        Determining if something is

        - Cat or Dog
        - Spam or not Spam

    Multiclass classification
        classify multiple different items of objects

        Plant Species


Regression - predict continuous 
    - Predicting Stock Price
    - Predicting House Vlaue 
    - Predicting Temperature


HOW TO USE A SUPERVISED LEARNING DATA SET 

TRAINING DATA SET 
    feeds into the model
    calculate the loss (how far off from the desired value)

VALIDATION DATA SET
    used as a reality check during.after training to ensure model can handle unseen DATA
    SIMILAR TO TRAINING DATA but IS NOT fed back into the model 
    LOSS from using the validation set is not fed back in

TEST DATA SET 
    Used to check how generalised the final chosen model is

LOSS
    There are different types of determining loss
    This is known as a loss function that determines this loss

    L1 loss = sum(|y_real - y_predicted|)
